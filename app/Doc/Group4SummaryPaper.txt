The journey that our group had I think it was a bit rough in the beginning but once we started getting toward the end of the project I think everyone was able to help one way or another. We meet a total of 5 times as a group not including the time where maybe two to three people meet up on the side to figure out the project. Each time we did meet up as a group we mange to accomplish what we set out or come very close to accomplishing due to time management. With the first group meeting that we had we decided that we would start from scratch since we spent most of our time trying to understand Dr. Laufer’s model, it was a bit confusing to understand plus one of our group members already started on the project without the help of Dr. Laufer’s code. This was all changed when we started to work with the code that we decided to work on. We decided to go with Dr. Laufer’s model, but we thought that Dr. Laufer’s model was a bit difficult to understand and use still. So what we did as a group was that we would use both Dr. Laufer’s model and start from scratch. We used the simplicity of our code and the layout of Dr. Laufer’s model so that we are able to work on it and know what we are doing. The third meeting is when we started to work on the test. We had a total of 4 tests that need to be finish and we finished three tests that meeting. The fourth meeting we finished the last test with there was a second group that was trying to add the sound in the project. The fifth meeting we finished the sound and worked on roboletric. The next day a member figured out roboletric. What we saw that having the best of both worlds was better then one, since we decided to start from scratch but then later decided to work off Dr. Laufer’s model.
